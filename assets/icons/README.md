# Icons for LeetScare Extension

This directory should contain three PNG icon files:
- `16.png` - 16x16 pixels (for toolbar)
- `48.png` - 48x48 pixels (for extension management page)
- `128.png` - 128x128 pixels (for Chrome Web Store)

## Quick Setup

1. Open `generate-icons.html` in your browser (from the project root)
2. Click the "Save" buttons for each icon size
3. Save them in this directory as `16.png`, `48.png`, and `128.png`

Alternatively, you can create your own icons with:
- Background: Purple gradient (#667eea to #764ba2)
- Foreground: Spider/web design or ghost emoji
- Size: Must be exact (16x16, 48x48, 128x128)

For now, you can copy the existing `icon.png` from the root and rename it, though properly sized icons are recommended.
